        An “About Me,” also known as a blurb, is a short piece of writing that informs your reader
        about your professional background,

        key accomplishments, personal values and any brands you may be associated with.
        Personal websites, social media profiles and
        company directories often feature “About Me” sections. A blurb is an opportunity to
        quickly give important details about yourself
        to potential business contacts like clients, vendors, employers or anyone who wants
        to get to know you better.
        “About Me” writings can vary in length, tone, content and point of view. For example,
        a social media blurb might be shorter,
        more informal and written with first-person “I” statements. Blurbs for a company website
        might include more details, use a
        professional tone and show your full name. However, you have a lot of freedom in choosing
        the length and style of your “About Me.”

Blurbs are important because they quickly give potential business contacts the most relevant
        information about you. Because an “About Me” can be less formal than a candidate profile
        on a resume, it can also be a chance to use
        humor or a personal story to help the reader become familiar with you.
